## Introduction
Welcome to the Multi-Object Tracking System repository! This project aims to provide an advanced multi-object tracking solution that accurately detects and tracks multiple objects in video sequences. The system utilizes robust scaling preprocessing, feature matrix integration, and state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models.

## Features
- Accurate multi-object tracking with robust scaling and feature matrix integration
- Handling of occlusions, scale variations, and complex object interactions
- Predictive capabilities for future object location estimation
- Integration of popular deep learning-based object detection models
- Easy setup and usage with detailed instructions
